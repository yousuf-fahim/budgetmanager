**Technology and OOP Approach**

The software will be developed using C++ programming language and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to achieve modularity, maintainability, and performance. The following OOP concepts will be utilized:



**Classes and Objects:** Creating classes for entities like User, Transaction, Budget, etc., and utilizing objects for data manipulation.

**Inheritance:** Designing a hierarchy of classes for better code organization and code reuse.

**Encapsulation:** Encapsulating data and methods within classes to control access and maintain code integrity.

**Polymorphism:** Employing polymorphism to create flexible and extensible code.
Development Phases



**Project Planning and Requirement Gathering:** Defining project scope, requirements, and objectives.

**System Design:** Creating the software architecture and class diagrams.

**Implementation:** Developing the software using C++ and OOP principles.

**Testing:** Conducting unit testing and integration testing to ensure software quality.

**User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Involving users for feedback and refinement.

**Bug Fixes and Refinements:** Addressing feedback and making necessary improvements.

**Deployment and Launch:** Deploying the software for public use.



**Conclusion**
The Personal Budget Manager Software using C++ and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is an essential tool to help individuals achieve financial stability and make informed financial decisions. With a focus on modularity, maintainability, and user-friendly design, the software aims to empower users to take control of their finances effectively.
